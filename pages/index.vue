                        We do offer the option of upgrading your account for a small monthly fee, but this is not required.
                        Upgrading your account may result in more opportunities in addition to early payout options.
                        You can view the benefits by going to the Upgrade Account page in your profile.

                            What brands do you work with?
                        </template>
                        We work with hundreds of brands and businesses, both big and small, and covering almost every niche. Some of the most popular niches are Health & Fitness, Food & Drink, Home, Fashion, Business, and Tech. As soon as we sell an opportunity for you, you will be provided with the info on the brand that we are looking to collaborate with you on.

                            How and when do you send payments?

                        All payments are made through Paypal, so make sure that the proper Paypal email is included in your profile. On the 1st of each month we send out Paypal payments for all opportunities completed the previous month. Depending on your account, you may need a minimum balance to receive this. You can also choose to be paid out as early as 72 hours after completing an opportunity, but a small fee may be deducted based on the type of account you have.

                        After you have created your profile and added your channels, we can now start promoting your channels to brands that are looking to connect with influencers in your niche. It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to start sending opportunities your way. As soon as an opportunity has been sold for one of your channels, you will be notified through email, as well as on your Dashboard.

                        </template>
                        As soon as you are notified of an opportunity, you should log into your account to view the details of that opportunity since most are time-sensitive. After reviewing the instructions, you can Accept the opportunity, and pick an estimated time of publishing, or you can Reject the opportunity if it is not a good fit. If you Accept, you will have timeframe to complete the opportunity, and you can complete this by confirming the placement on the opportunity details page.

                        This will help us to identify you as the owner of that account, as well as to provide public info like followers and engagement. This does not provide access to any sensitive data, or the ability to post on your page.

                    <question>
                        <template slot="header">
                            When inputting my price for an Opportunity Type, why do I see a price range?
                        </template>
                        For some brands we work with, we need to include a discount to make the offer more attractive. The max discount that we would offer is 20%. Therefore, if you input a price of $100, the lowest you would receive for a direct opportunity would be $80. We want to make sure that you are getting what you need to receive, so if $80 is not enough, we would recommend raising your price to account for any possible discount.

                    <question>
                        <template slot="header">
                            Can you explain what Groups are?
                        </template>
                        My Groups is a way of grouping blog, social, and video channels that are connected in some manner. For example, if you have a blog called TheIncredibleBlogger.com, and you have an Instagram @TheIncredibleBlogger, which is connected, you should create a group called The Incredible Blogger. This will make it easier for us to present all of your connected channels to interested brands and businesses.

                    <question>
                        <template slot="header">
                            Is there anything I can do to receive more opportunities?
                        </template>
                        Price is always a big factor in the decision of a brand, so lowering it to a more attractive figure could result in more opportunities. You have full control over this, so if you start to receive a lot more opportunities and want to raise the price, you can do so anytime. Additionally, by upgrading your account to a Premium or Professional account, your channels will be promoted in more proposals to clients, which may lead to more opportunities.
